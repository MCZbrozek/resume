Throughout that time he demonstrated an ability to learn and adapt quickly, thriving in the ambiguity that comes with starting at a new company and learning the ropes of how things work there. He is incredibly hard working, dedicated to constant growth, and a general joy to be around. Myself and all of his teammates really enjoyed having him on the team. Technically, Michael tackled two large projects during his internship. One on the frontend, public facing website and the other on the server side as part of our public API made available to partners. In both projects he helped scope, design, and implement work in several areas of Strava's code bases. He took on learning new languages, frameworks, and architecture patterns with eagerness and enthusiasm, walking that line of knowing when to ask to help but trying all solutions before he reached out. His contributions have made an impact to Strava as a company and the team(s) he worked with.”"
